## ‚ö° Quick Start Example

Get started in 3 simple steps:

```bash
# 1. Clone and install
git clone https://github.com/uditrpanchal/ai-hedge-fund-yfinance-free.git
cd ai-hedge-fund-yfinance-free
poetry install

# 2. Set up your LLM API key (required)
cp .env.example .env
# Edit .env and add your OPENAI_API_KEY (or other LLM key)

# 3. Run analysis on any stock
poetry run python src/main.py --ticker NVDA
```

**That's it!** No financial data API key required. üéâ

**Want better news sentiment?** (Optional but recommended)
```bash
# Add Alpha Vantage key to .env for pre-computed sentiment scores
ALPHA_VANTAGE_API_KEY=your-key-here
```

## How to Install

Before you can run the AI Hedge Fund, you'll need to install it and set up your API keys. These steps are common to both the full-stack web application and command line interface.

### 1. Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/uditrpanchal/ai-hedge-fund-yfinance-free.git
cd ai-hedge-fund-yfinance-free
```

Or if you're cloning from the original repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/virattt/ai-hedge-fund.git
cd ai-hedge-fund
```

### 2. Set up API keys

Create a `.env` file for your API keys:
```bash
# Create .env file for your API keys (in the root directory)
cp .env.example .env
```

Open and edit the `.env` file to add your LLM API key:
```bash
# Required: At least one LLM API key
OPENAI_API_KEY=your-openai-api-key
# OR
ANTHROPIC_API_KEY=your-anthropic-api-key
# OR
DEEPSEEK_API_KEY=your-deepseek-api-key
# OR
GROQ_API_KEY=your-groq-api-key

# Optional: For enhanced news sentiment analysis (recommended)
ALPHA_VANTAGE_API_KEY=your-alpha-vantage-api-key
```

#### Required: LLM API Key

You **must** set at least one LLM API key for the hedge fund to work:
- **OpenAI** (GPT-4, GPT-4o, etc.): Get key from https://platform.openai.com/
- **Anthropic** (Claude): Get key from https://anthropic.com/
- **DeepSeek** (DeepSeek-R1): Get key from https://deepseek.com/
- **Groq** (Fast inference): Get key from https://groq.com/

#### Optional: News Sentiment API Key

For high-quality news sentiment analysis with pre-computed scores:

**Alpha Vantage** (Recommended):
- **Get it here**: https://www.alphavantage.co/support/#api-key
- **Free tier**: 500 API calls per day
- **Benefits**: 
  - Pre-computed sentiment scores (saves LLM calls)
  - Higher reliability than yfinance news
  - Reduces costs by ~80% for sentiment analysis
- **Fallback**: If not configured, system uses yfinance news API (may have limited availability)

#### Financial Data (No API Key Required!)

All stock prices, financial statements, metrics, and insider trades are fetched using the free **yfinance** library:
- ‚úÖ **No API key needed**
- ‚úÖ **No ticker restrictions** (analyze any stock)
- ‚úÖ **Unlimited usage**
- ‚úÖ **Completely free**

## How to Run

### ‚å®Ô∏è Command Line Interface

You can run the AI Hedge Fund directly via terminal. This approach offers more granular control and is useful for automation, scripting, and integration purposes.

<img width="992" alt="Screenshot 2025-01-06 at 5 50 17 PM" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/e8ca04bf-9989-4a7d-a8b4-34e04666663b" />

#### Quick Start

1. Install Poetry (if not already installed):
```bash
curl -sSL https://install.python-poetry.org | python3 -
```

2. Install dependencies:
```bash
poetry install
```

#### Run the AI Hedge Fund

**Analyze any stock** (no restrictions):
```bash
# Single ticker
poetry run python src/main.py --ticker NVDA

# Multiple tickers
poetry run python src/main.py --ticker AAPL,MSFT,NVDA,TSLA,GOOGL

# International stocks
poetry run python src/main.py --ticker TSM,BABA,NVO
```

**Use local LLMs** (Ollama):
```bash
poetry run python src/main.py --ticker AAPL,MSFT,NVDA --ollama
```

**Analyze specific time period**:
```bash
poetry run python src/main.py --ticker AAPL,MSFT,NVDA --start-date 2024-01-01 --end-date 2024-03-01
```

**Example Output with Alpha Vantage:**
```
Fetching news for NVDA from Alpha Vantage...
‚úì Retrieved 50 articles from Alpha Vantage with sentiment scores
‚úì Aswath Damodaran    [NVDA] Done
‚úì Fundamentals Analyst[NVDA] Done
‚úì News Sentiment      [NVDA] Done (0 LLM calls - sentiments pre-computed)
‚úì Technical Analyst   [NVDA] Done
‚úì Valuation Analyst   [NVDA] Done
‚úì Portfolio Manager   [NVDA] Done

TRADING DECISION: [NVDA]
Action: SHORT | Quantity: 99 | Confidence: 80%
Reasoning: Strong bearish valuation signals outweigh bullish sentiment
```

#### Run the Backtester
```bash
poetry run python src/backtester.py --ticker AAPL,MSFT,NVDA
```

**Example Output:**

Note: The `--ollama`, `--start-date`, and `--end-date` flags work for the backtester, as well!

### üñ•Ô∏è Web Application

The new way to run the AI Hedge Fund is through our web application that provides a user-friendly interface. This is recommended for users who prefer visual interfaces over command line tools.

Please see detailed instructions on how to install and run the web application [here](https://github.com/virattt/ai-hedge-fund/tree/main/app).

## üîÑ What's Different from the Original?

This fork replaces paid APIs with free alternatives while maintaining full functionality:

### Financial Data Migration
| **Feature** | **Original** | **This Fork** |
|------------|-------------|---------------|
| Price Data | Financial Datasets API | yfinance (free) |
| Financial Statements | Financial Datasets API | yfinance (free) |
| Insider Trades | Financial Datasets API | yfinance (free) |
| Company Metrics | Financial Datasets API | yfinance (free) |
| News Sentiment | Financial Datasets API | Alpha Vantage (free) + yfinance fallback |
| **API Key Required** | ‚úÖ Yes (paid after free tier) | ‚ùå No (optional for news) |
| **Ticker Restrictions** | Only 5 free tickers | ‚úÖ All tickers unlimited |

### Benefits of This Fork
- üí∞ **Lower Costs**: No financial data API subscription needed
- üåç **Global Tickers**: Analyze any stock from any market
- üöÄ **Faster Setup**: One less API key to configure
- üìä **Same Quality**: Equivalent data from trusted sources
- üîÑ **Better News**: Alpha Vantage provides pre-computed sentiment scores

## üêõ Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**Problem**: "No news articles found" or yfinance HTTP 401 errors
- **Solution**: Add `ALPHA_VANTAGE_API_KEY` to your `.env` file for reliable news sentiment
- **Why**: yfinance news API can be unreliable due to Yahoo Finance authentication changes

**Problem**: "Module not found" errors
- **Solution**: Run `poetry install` to install all dependencies including yfinance

**Problem**: Financial metrics showing `None` values
- **Solution**: Some tickers may have incomplete data in yfinance. Try major US stocks (AAPL, MSFT, GOOGL) first

**Problem**: Slow performance
- **Solution**: Alpha Vantage significantly reduces LLM calls for sentiment analysis. Add the API key for better performance.
